Final Project of Practical Machine Learning Course at Coursera.org

This document contains the development of a prediction model based on data collected four wearable devices in six participants
practicing physical exercises into five categories, one correct and the other four featuring some types of error. 
Having the solution proposed (a prediction algorithm), it is possible, collecting data of an individual practicing
physical exercises to determine the type of qualification.
